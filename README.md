# Rosetta Code Tasks
[Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) is a [programming chrestomathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy) site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. Rosetta Code currently has 1,147 [tasks](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Solutions_by_Programming_Task), 348 draft tasks, and is aware of 856 languages, though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every language.
